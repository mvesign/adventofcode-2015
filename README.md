# Advent Of Code - 2015

Advent of code. Every day two challenges, which needs to be resolved with coding. Did start this waaaaay back. But my interest never sticks, so I abandoned it before finishing. Still going to try to finalize it... I guess.

I've choosen .NET as the language I;m going to write my creation in. So to continue with each challenge, you'll need (at least) .NET 5 with C# 9.

## Structure

Each day part is placed in a separate directory with it's own files.

## Setup a challenge

### 1. Go to the main directory
```
cd C:\Projects\GitHub\adventofcode-2015
```

### 2. Create a new directory
```
mkdir day-1-1
cd .\day-1-1
```

### 3. Create a new project
```
dotnet new console
```

## Check a challenge.

### 1. Go to the directory of the day part.
```
cd C:\Projects\GitHub\adventofcode-2015\day-1-1
```

### 2. Build the project (optional).
```
dotnet build
```

### 3. Execute the solution.
```
dotnet run
```
